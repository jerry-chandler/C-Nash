# C-Nash
Generation code and datasets of 1,130 Nash Equilibrium (NE) problems, including 113 classes with increasing number of actions, starting from 64, 68, .., and up to 512. 
Each class contains 10 distinct NE problems. 
In each problem, each element of the two payoff matrices is randomly assigned a value between -8 and +8.
